## Class Hierarchy in Unreal

- Object // base class for all object in Unreal

e.g. Camera

☝️

- Actor - anything that is placed/spawned in the world

e.g. Wall, Weapon

☝️

- Pawn - actors that can <ins>receive inputs</ins> from players or AIs

e.g. Flying vehicle

☝️

 - Character - pawn of which Unreal implements walking movement

e.g. player

<br>

... We can create *New C++ Class* from the UE editor which derives from the above classes.

Notes:

- We need to ensure that the macro `GENERATED_BODY()` generated by Unreal Engine is <ins>in the first line</ins> of such a class.

- Classes derived from `Actor` has a method `BeginPlay()` which is called whenever the actor is spawned.

## Class Prefixes

Unreal expects classes to be prefixed consistently.

- U - Classes directly deriving from UObject
- A - Classes directly deriving from Actor
- F - Structs
- E - Enums
- I - Interfaces

## Character

- To start with a Character we created in a level, set its `Auto Possess Player` to `Player0`.

- The camera attaching to the player Character and the arm that can be used to link between the player Character and the camera (to make a 3rd-person view) can be represented as `protected` data members (in the player Character class) of type `UCameraComponent` and `USpringArmComponent` respectively.

- A nice property of `USpringArmComponent` is that collision detection is applied to automatically adjust the length of the arm so that there's never obstacles in between what are linked by the spring arm.

- `UCameraComponent` and `USpringArmComponent` have method called `SetupAttachment()` which can attach the component to what is passed to this method (e.g. `CameraComp->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);` where `CameraComp` is an `UCameraComponent` and `RootComponent` is a data member in Actor represent the root of the attachment hierarchy (e.g. the collision volume of the Actor) for the Actor).

- Components of a Charactor (e.g. `UCameraComponent` and `USpringArmComponent`) can be instantiated from the function `CreateDefaultSubobject<SubobjectType>(string)`. This function can only be used inside constructor. Note that the `string` we pass to this function will be the name of the component shown in the Unreal editor.

- Unreal property system contains all those macros in unreal engine that start with `U`.

  For example, `UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere)`, where `VisibleAnywhere` is a specifier, exposes the component follows it to unreal editor & Blueprints.
